                Average Wildfire Hazard Potential(AWHP):<br>
                The AWHP is the average of all the WHP scores registered for a specific county.

            <p class = "info-box" id = "pop_score_info">
                Weighted Average Wildfire Hazard Potential (PW-AWHP):<br>
                The PW-AWHP takes the AWHP and adjusts the value based on population density in a county.
                A county with higher population density will be weighted more heavily than a county with
                lower population density. 
            </p>
            <p class = "info-box">
                By weighing the AWHP of a county against its population average it is possible to get an
                estimate of the impact upon population if a fire was uncontained. For example, Malheur County 
                in Oregon has an AWHP of 2.85 but so few people live there that it's PW-AWHP is only 0.649. <br>

            with the goal "to depict the relative potential for wildfire that would be difficult for suppression resources to contain."<br>
