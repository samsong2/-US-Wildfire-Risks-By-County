                This visualization utilizes Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) score data produced by the 
                <a href="https://www.firelab.org/project/wildfire-hazard-potential" target='_blank'>USDA Forest Service Fire Modeling Institute</a> 
                whose goal is "to depict the relative potential for wildfire that would be difficult for suppression resources to contain." 
                The scale ranges from 0 to 5 with 5 being the highest risk. Scores are only produced for contiguous United States.<br>
                The average WHP is the average of all the scores registered for a specific county 
                while the population-weighted average WHP is adjusted based on population density in a county, 
                i.e. how much impact upon population if a fire was uncontained. For example, Malheur County 
                in Oregon has an average WHP of 2.85 but so few people live there that it's adjusted WHP is only 0.649. <br>
                Hover over a specific county to see some additional demographic data points about it and toggle 
                between the two maps to see the colors change for each county.
